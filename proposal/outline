Problem: Using areial photographs coupled with computer vision, bison need to be identified(adult or juvenile), counted and location logged.

Research
  -Evaluate existing computer vision algorithms as applied to our problem. 
  -Possible candidates, OpenCV, Leptonica, etc.
  -Experiement with pre/post-processing. ie, guassian blur, masks/filters, etc.
  -Edge detection, blob detection, neural networks.
  -Computer training/learning.
  
Dev
  -Develop a database to orgainize data.
  -Adapt and/or combine the findings of algorithm research. 
  -Validate solution with test data.
  
Implementation
  -Optimize algorithm.
  -Automate the process.
  
Further applications/research
  -Allow solution to scale to ground level cameras.
  -Use solution for video.
  -Identify non-bison animals.

  ****Addition options.
    -Mosaic all images and get one count
    -neural network 
        -hyper neat
        -HOG -neural networks
